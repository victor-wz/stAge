Code and data to reproduce the results from ‘Multi-tissue spatial transcriptomics reveals biological age hotspots in mouse and human aging’.


### Abstract:
Aging is heterogeneous across tissues, yet regional aging patterns within tissues remain unclear. Here we develop stAge, a framework that quantifies localized transcriptomic age (tAge) from spatial transcriptomics data in mouse and human samples during natural aging and in response to injury, infection, neurodegeneration, and cancer. stAge captures age difference among samples and provides a single multi-tissue model to examine aging within and across organs. Across tissues and species, stAge uncovers spatial gradients of biological age and shows that injury and neurodegeneration induce pronounced age acceleration, with stronger responses in older organisms and partial normalization during tissue recovery. With age, tissues develop significant hotspots of accelerated aging and coldspots of preserved resilience. Hotspots are enriched for energy metabolism and immune aging signatures, whereas chromatin-related signatures are associated with coldspots. These findings show that aging is spatially structured within tissues and lay a foundation for spatially targeted rejuvenation strategies.<img width="468" height="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3fb1b78-7bb4-4f1b-a22e-7dc02da43aec" />
